                                <p align="justify"> Every person has dignity and value. One of the ways that we recognize
                                    the fundamental worth of every person is by acknowledging and respecting their human
                                    rights. Human rights are a set of principles concerned with equality and fairness.
                                    They recognize our freedom to make choices about our lives and to develop our
                                    potential as human beings. They are about living a life free from fear, harassment
                                    or discrimination.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Human rights can broadly be defined as a number of basic rights that
                                    people from around the world have agreed are essential. These include the right to
                                    life, the right to a fair trial, freedom from torture and other cruel and inhuman
                                    treatment, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the rights to health,
                                    education and an adequate standard of living. </p>
                                <p align="justify">These human rights are the same for all people everywhere – men and
                                    women, young and old, rich and poor, regardless of our background, where we live,
                                    what we think or what we believe. This is what makes human rights ‘universal’.</p>
                                <p align="justify">In order to live with dignity certain basic rights and freedoms are
                                    necessary, which all Human beings are entitled to, these basic rights are called
                                    human rights. Human rights demand recognition and respect for the inherent dignity
                                    to ensure that everyone is protected against abuses which undermine their dignity,
                                    and give the opportunities they need to realize their full potential, free from
                                    discrimination. </p>
