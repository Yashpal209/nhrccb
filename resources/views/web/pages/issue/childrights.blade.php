                        <p align="justify">They are abandoned. They do not get a chance to step into a school. They are
                            left to fend for themselves on the streets. They suffer from many forms of violence. They do
                            not have access to even primary healthcare. They are subjected to cruel treatment every day.
                            They are children—innocent, young, and beautiful—who are deprived of their rights.</p>
                        <p align="justify">In the history of human rights, the rights of children are the most ratified.
                            The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) defines child rights as the
                            minimum entitlements and freedoms that should be afforded to every citizen below the age of
                            18 regardless of race or nationality. Every person has dignity and value. One of the ways
                            that we recognize the fundamental worth of every person is by acknowledging and respecting
                            their human rights.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Human rights are a set of principles concerned with equality and fairness.
                            They recognize our freedom to make choices about our lives and to develop our potential as
                            human beings. They are about living a life free from fear, harassment, or discrimination.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">Human rights can broadly be defined as several basic rights that people from
                            around the world have agreed are essential. These include the right to life, the right to a
                            fair trial, freedom from torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment, freedom of speech,
                            freedom of religion, and the right to health, education, and an adequate standard of living.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">These human rights are the same for all people everywhere—men and women,
                            young and old, rich and poor, regardless of our background, where we live, what we think, or
                            what we believe. This is what makes human rights ‘universal.’ Origin, color, gender,
                            language, religion, opinions, origin, wealth, birth status, disability, or other
                            characteristics. These rights encompass the freedom of children and their civil rights,
                            family environment, necessary healthcare and welfare, education, leisure and cultural
                            activities, and special protection measures. The UNCRC outlines the fundamental human rights
                            that should be afforded to children in four broad classifications that suitably cover all
                            civil, political, social, economic, and cultural rights of every child: </p>

            <h3 class="text-center mt-4">IMPACT OF THE CONVENTION OF THE CHILD RIGHTS</h3>
            <p align="justify">A milestone in international human rights legislation, the Convention on the Rights of
                the Child has been instrumental in putting all the issues about children's issues on the global as well
                as national agenda. In addition to this, it has extensively mobilized actions for the realization of the
                rights and development of children worldwide.</p>
            <p align="justify">It was not an overnight initiative that resulted in the adoption of child rights. It took
                several years of movements and activism to shape favorable, positive, and constructive attitudes toward
                children and also incite actions to improve their well-being. The enormous efforts involved in the
                implementation of the Convention, the significant amount of resources committed to this cause, and the
                overall effectiveness of the systems put in place for the execution process have a bearing on the
                success of child well-being outcomes.</p>
            <p align="justify">Over the last 20 or so years, implementation of the Convention and its effect on child
                well-being varied from country to country and from one region of the world to the other. Based on
                analysis, there has been outstanding progress at a global level in addressing the issues related to
                children. These include progress in access to services, reaching their fullest potential through
                education, enactment of laws that uphold the principle of the best interests of the child, and child
                survival.</p>
            <p align="justify">Though noteworthy progress has been achieved, in developing countries, particularly
                India, there is still a long way to go in realizing the rights of children. Though all the relevant
                rules and policies are in place, there is a lack of enforcement initiatives. As barriers, several
                factors forbid the effective implementation of the laws. Due to relatively low success in achieving
                concrete child development outcomes in India, the condition of underprivileged kids and underprivileged
                youth is harsh and needs urgent attention. There is a need to intensify efforts for children's welfare
                at all levels to implement the rules and provisions of the Convention and contribute to creating a world
                suitable for children.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <h3 class="text-center mt-4">CHILD RIGHTS AND THE WORLD</h3>
            <p align="justify">People from across the world striving for social justice have often directed their
                efforts toward the most vulnerable in society—the children. From Princess Diana’s charitable work on
                behalf of children to the efforts of activists like Grace Abbott and the youngest Nobel laureate in
                history—Ms. Malala Yousafzai, these famous children’s rights activist have put commendable efforts into
                helping improve the lives of the youngest citizens.</p>
            <p align="justify">2014 Nobel Peace Prize awardees Ms. Malala Yousafzai and Mr. Kailash Satyarthi have
                reminded us all of the need to keep on advancing in providing opportunities that has an important effect
                on all children. The opportunities are meant to be meaningful enough to allow them to learn and gain the
                mindsets and skills that would empower them to be free and develop themselves, their communities and the
                world.</p>
            <p align="justify">Mr. Kailash Satyarthi’s struggle to liberate children from child labor had cost him many
                life threats, including bullet wounds by those who exploit young boys and girls for economic gain.
                Wearing flak jackets and armed with strong determination, he and his team raided many illegal factories
                and mines to rescue the children who were sold into servitude. It has been 30 years now since he started
                his movement. A movement that has one clear purpose—no child shall be a slave.</p>
            <p align="justify">On the other hand, when one thinks of Ms. Malala Yousafzai, the first thing that pops
                into one’s mind is education. The second is education for girls. In 2009, when she was just 11, she
                wrote to the BBC about the norm of banning female education under the Taliban regime in the Swat Valley
                (her hometown). Her article gained tremendous momentum worldwide. She started her fight for the
                education of girls at that small age and began to speak publicly and to the press, which caused her and
                her family to receive constant death threats.</p>
            <em>“I strongly feel that this is a big honor for hundreds of millions of children who have been deprived of
                their childhood and freedom and education.” </em>
            <p align="right">- Mr. Kailash Satyarthi.</p>
            <em>“I speak not for myself but for those without voice… those who have fought for their rights… their right
                to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, and
                their right to be educated.”</em>
