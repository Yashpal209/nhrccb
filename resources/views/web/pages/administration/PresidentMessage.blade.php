                            <h4>President Message</h4>
                            <p align="justify">“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.” These opening words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights express a concept of man which underpins the framework of human rights embodied in the Universal Declaration and the two international covenants of Human Rights. It is a concept which, it derives most directly from Western political traditions, is in harmony with moral and social teachings to be found in many other traditions and patterns of belief. I am delighted to introduce National Human Rights and Crime Control Bureau a leading social organization, working for the protection of Human rights, liberties and social justice for all people at National & International Level and providing legal assistance to the needy and under-privileged of the Indian Union, centers operating for the cause of spreading human rights awareness in order to break the barriers of class, caste, creed, color and religion. National Human Rights and Crime Control Bureau (NHRCCB) promotes art, culture, peace, harmony and brotherhood. National Human Rights and Crime Control Bureau’s message is taken throughout the length and breadth of this country by its active members. National Human Rights and Crime Control Burea has several branches in India and , having Thousands of dedicated volunteers and Officers. NHRCCB is a social organization for the ignored, disregarded, over-looked, victimized, oppressed, depressed, tortured people of the society and it cultivates awareness in them with regard to their rights. NHRCCB is a highly informative secured Human Rights Agency in the service of the humanity with full Legal status. NHRCCB also delicately operating various rehabilitation courses, vocational training, higher education free of cost at every part of the corner, having control office HAPPINESS and SORROW are meant to be shared. No one should be considered High or Low in the eyes of even the God men. So should all be treated equally in the eyes of the State and the governmental machinery. Gone are the days of bonded labor and slavery! It should be considered a crime to ill-treat any one on account of gender, age, caste, color or religion.</p>
